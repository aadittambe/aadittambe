# 👋🏽 Hi, I am Aadit!

I am a journalist and developer who specializes in visual storytelling — I build interactive graphics and create web presentations to help people understand the news and make sense of the policies that impact them. 

Currently, I work on the design team at The Washington Post. Previosuly, I was a data reporting fellow at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland, and have interned at NBC News on the data and graphics team.
