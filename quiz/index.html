      <p>Goucher College released its latest poll results last week, with survey questions that touched on the COVID-19
        pandemic, hot-button topics like abortion and leader performance in the country and state.
      </p>
      <p>The Goucher College Poll focuses on the opinions of Maryland residents, with students from the college
        assisting in research questions, surveying and analyzing the questions. The test sample included 700 Maryland
        residents.
      </p>
      <p>In order to make sure all Maryland residents are represented in the poll, surveyors used a method called random
        digit dialing, which works with a “county-level stratified sample” using cell phone numbers and landlines.
      </p>
      <p>The poll was released in three parts. Below, the Capital News Service pulled several poll questions to see how
        your opinions compare to poll responses from the Maryland general public.

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic hit Maryland in early March. Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency on
          March 5, 2020 when three Maryland residents were confirmed positive for coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p>Things happened quickly after that: places began to shut down, schools moved to a virtual environment and by
          the end of the month, Hogan issued a stay at home order. In April, the mask mandate was put in place.
        </p>
        <p>The Goucher Poll found, in addition to what Marylanders are predicting for the future, that 79 percent of
          Marylanders approved of how Hogan handled the pandemic. Last year, 82 percent approved.
